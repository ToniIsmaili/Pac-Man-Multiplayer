Game engine: Unity
##Gamemodes:
###Tag
One Pac-Man and n amount of ghosts start on the map with the goal of getting the best score.
The mission of the player playing Pac-Man is getting the biggest score possible while avoiding the ghosts, on the other hand, the ghosts try to catch the player.
When the ghost catches Pac-Man they swap places, the player that got caught will spawn in the “cage” where ghosts spawn as a ghost, and the other player will continue playing as Pac-Man.
Win condition: The winner will be determined based on the score after the timer runs out.
###Survival
	One ghost and n amount of Pac-Men start on the map, they are spread out equally while the ghost spawns in the middle.
	The mission of the ghost is to “infect” all the Pac-Men and turn them into ghosts before the timer runs out, while on the other hand the mission of the Pac-Men is either to be the last one alive or survive before the timer runs out.
	Win condition (pac-man): Survive until the timer runs out or you’re the last person alive.
	Win condition (ghost): Kill all the Pac-Men before the timmer runs out.


##Themes:
Each theme will have their unique set of mechanics, sound effects and music.
###Pink theme
	This theme can be looked at as the easy mode, the music will be more cute and chill, you can see the whole map and overall the gameplay is more relaxed.
###Light mode
This theme can be looked at as the normal mode, the music will gradually get more intense, the Pac-Man can see in a fairly large radius around him while the ghosts can see the entire map, the ghost is slightly faster than the Pac-Man and overall the gameplay is more intense.
###Dark mode
	This theme can be looked at as the hard mode, the music will be more chaotic and intense and it will only get more intense, the Pac-Man can see in a small radius around him while the ghost can see in a bigger radius around him, the ghost is faster than Pac-Man and overall the gameplay will be very intense.


##Maps:
The maps will be randomly generated, and possibly pre-defined maps that we will create.
Every time there are no coins left to be collected, the map will change and it will get more difficult while at the same time the score increases faster.


##Power-Ups:
Power-Ups will randomly spawn in the map, and will stay there for a certain amount of time until someone picks them up or they despawn.
Players will be able to pick up one power-up and use it when they want, but they can only carry one power-up at any time. The player has the ability to use the power-up or drop it (when dropped the power-up despawns).
	There are two types of power-ups: Player based and Tile based.
###Player based
	Player based power-ups, when used, will in some way buff the player, meaning that the stats of that particular player change.
	The player based power-ups are:
Invincibility - you become immune to the ghosts and can kill them (score reward).
Invisibility - you become invisible to others but you still are vulnerable and can die.
Speed up - you walk faster.
Teleportation - you can teleport through walls.
###Tile based
	Tile based power-ups, when used, will give a special effect to the tiles, meaning that whoever stands on those tiles will be affected by them.
	The tile based power-ups are:
Speed up - increases the speed for players standing on them.
Slow down - decreases the speed for players standing on them.
